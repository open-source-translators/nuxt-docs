### Want to help with the translation?

If you feel okay with translating sorta alone, just fork the repo, create a "work-in-progress" pull request (mark it with [WIP], see [Russian translation](https://github.com/nuxt/docs/pull/3) if you need an example) — and just go on.

If you are more of a team player, maybe Translation Gang is for you? Then just let us know somehow that you're ready to join this international open-source translators community. Feel free to contact [Grigoriy Beziuk](https://gbezyuk.github.io) or anybody else from the team.

And thank you in advance ;)
